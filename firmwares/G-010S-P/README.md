Until very recently there were no other known Alcatel-Lucent/Nokia firmware verisions for the G-010S-P aside from

`3FE56853AOPD39`. Two new firmware versions have been recently discovered: `3FE56853AOPD99`, and `3FE56853BOPD09`.

There are no known published details on the changes that these images contain, however testing suggests that they

may contain fixes for 2.5G link auto-negotiation and disable the use of deprecated SSL/TLS cyphers.
